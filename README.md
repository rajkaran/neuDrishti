# Neutralinojs Version of Drishti: A Cutting-Edge Experiment  

**Neutralinojs Version of Drishti** is an experimental yet highly promising project aimed at revolutionizing the way we deploy and manage the Drishti app. Originally built in Python, Drishti has been a crucial part of our system. However, we wanted to optimize its performance, and that's where **Neutralinojs** comes in. A lightweight framework similar to ElectronJS but without the overhead of Chromium, Neutralinojs was the perfect choice to develop the next iteration of Drishti.  

This project represents a significant leap forward in simplifying and streamlining the deployment process for **Raspberry Pi**-based systems. By using Neutralinojs, we eliminated the need for Chromium, drastically reducing memory usage while maintaining a high level of performance.  

The core functionality of this app is to run the **Digital Menu Board** on Raspberry Pi, ensuring minimal resource consumption while delivering a sleek, fast user experience. What makes this version even more exciting is its ability to easily package and distribute across multiple platforms, including **Linux**, **ARM** devices, and **Windows**, offering a seamless solution for future expansion and updates.  

The **Neutralinojs Version of Drishti** is not just an improvement; it's the beginning of something much bigger. This app serves as a foundation for further enhancements to the Drishti ecosystem, paving the way for more features and greater versatility in the future.  

## Features  

- **Lightweight Alternative**: A highly optimized, low-resource alternative to our original Python app.  
- **No Chromium Overhead**: Eliminates the need for Chromium on Raspberry Pi, reducing memory consumption and improving performance.  
- **Easy Packaging & Updates**: Simplifies app packaging for easy cross-platform distribution, making firmware updates faster and more efficient.  
- **A Platform for Growth**: A starting point for adding more features and capabilities to the Drishti app as it evolves.  

This project is **currently live and under continuous development**, and we're excited about the future prospects it brings. With its minimal resource usage, easy update system, and seamless cross-platform compatibility, itâ€™s shaping up to be a game-changer for the Drishti ecosystem and beyond.  

**Built in 2022**, this app marks a pivotal point in our journey to create a modern, cutting-edge solution that will continue to evolve and impact the industry.
